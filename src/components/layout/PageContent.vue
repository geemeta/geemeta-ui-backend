            <p> Hi! This is an amazing UI! Is there a way to turn sidebar completely off with a simple body class, like that which is used to minimize the sidebar? Also, I’m looking for a way to make portlets fill the vertical space
              between the fixed header and fixed footer. I know that full height divs are a chore, but I’m wondering if you have already written any code that checks the height of the window and adjusts the height of an element
              that I could re-purpose or extend for these full height content areas? If you have, I’d love a tip on where to find it in app.js or wherever else. Otherwise any other suggestions you may have. Thanks a ton!Hi! This
